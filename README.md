# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sameer, a developer & hacker from India.

I am Sameer, a seventeen-year-old innovator, socio entrepreneur, and activist. I firmly believe in actively innovating and researching on global problems to bring about positive change. No matter what the opposition says or how tense the situations are, I always strive to do the right thing.
I have participated in several global competitions, including "NASA HERC," where my documentation skills helped my RFP rank in the top 15 globally. As a team leader at "The New York Academy of Science," I am constantly learning and leading my teams through diverse challenges in different sectors. I am proud to have received the silver honor award from "IAAC" and to have been appointed as an ambassador.

I firmly believe in giving back to the community. That is why I founded "GreenKingdom," an initiative that helps people overcome environmental and social problems that are often overlooked by authorities.

I am an aspiring master of all trades who wants to ideate, innovate, and implement solutions for a better future for everyone. To accomplish this mission, I am working on different projects, such as an EMP-based Drone, Bionic Arm, AI Integrated Medical Drone, etc. I have mobilized these solutions in the market with the help of my startup, "Kaizel Tech."
